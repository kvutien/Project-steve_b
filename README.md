# Steve_B Earth Observer
## Introduction
I visited some friends in Goshen, Indiana, USA, in 1991. I met there a group of Amish people. The head of the group could forecast the weather of the coming week quite accurately, although he had no meteorological academic background. He simply had a long observation experience, as a farmer. His friends even say that he could predict pretty well the yield of the coming season.

In the same line, I'm convinced that if people were given simple tools to observe satellite images they can build their own knowledge, and if they can share this knowledge among them, together they can anticipate on potential weather changes for their families.

With the technologies available in the 21st century, this is possible:
* Google Earth Engine brings free and up-to-date satellite images as well as powerful image processing tools.
* Flutter or React Native supports making mobile apps for Android and iOS.
* Blockchain tools can be used to share in a decentralised and trusted manner each one's analysis, and build up individual reputation, as in the Amish community.

In the honor of Steve Birky, my brother-in-law, who spent his life helping people in need, this is a mobile-based tool to observe by satellite the health of vegetation everywhere in the world.
